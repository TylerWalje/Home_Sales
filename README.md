## Module 22 Challenge Notes:
There are a couple things to address with this challenge. I got into some problems becasue of download/path issues with Spark and with Java. I recently got a new laptop and am having to re-download many things we did in class or I have done with tutors before. I had a tutoring session today but my tutor was unfortunately unable to assist me with the download/path issues, therefore, I had to try other ways to get Spark and Java to work. After attempting to do this locally on my Jupyter Notebook, I figured that trying a few different options on Google Colab might be better (which it was). I ended up installing Java and Spark directly in the Google Colab notebook (I kept that code for ease-of-use for you to run while grading). I also was able to ensure coding success by setting the environment variables in the notebook as well. 

My next hurdle came when I was trying to specify a path to read the formatted parquet data to. I had problems with this step (I suspect it's because of the same issues I had while with the path's of Java and Spark, but that's only a suspicion. The two issues may be unrelated, but that came to mind) because I could not get anything to output correctly to the right location. Therefore, I used a technique that we recently learned in class, which was sending the files to Google Drive first. That was successful, and I was able to download the files and put them in my local repository. At that point, I made sure all my files were organized and used gitbash to update my repository.

I was able to cache and uncache the data, successfully run queries and create tables without issue. The main part of this challenge went well, but there was certainly lots of troubleshooting along the way!

Thank you.
